          A question that has haunted us humans since the dawn of time, these
          two simple sentences are something I’ve heard and experienced my
          entire life. Whether it’s with family, friends, or your significant
          other, finding the restaurant to eat at, let alone the dish, more
          often than not is a rough and painful process. I understand, being put
          on the spot to figure out where you’re gonna eat is not always easy.
          But not anymore with this website! Using the
          <a href="https://foodish-api.com/" class="foodish">Foodish API</a>,
          this website simply displays a random photo of a food dish. If you
          want that cuisine, press yes and it will take you to the nearest
          places that serve that food. And if not, just press no and a new image
          of food will appear. Problem solved!!!
